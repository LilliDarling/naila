In progress

The intent of this project is to understand and build an AI system. I am using Python as the 
main language and taking advantage of the several libraries available in order to build an NLP. 
**NAILA** will initially be able to recognize speech, update calendars, control volume and other 
functions, open apps, and have the same basic functionalities as Bixby or Alexa. From there, she 
will expand to run diagnostic tests, monitor security systems being built by my partner, and 
hopefully develop her own personality. She is intended to be based off of **JARVIS** but taken even 
further in complexity and integration. 

Due to the complexity of this project, documentation will be slowly updated and branches will be 
kept to the main branch for now until the initial NLP has been solidified.
